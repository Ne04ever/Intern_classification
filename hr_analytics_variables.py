# HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
### Prediction who will move to a new job.
##### Context and Content:
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses which conduct by the company. Many people signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.
#### 1. Data Source 
We found this dataset from kaggle, a series of files. The dataset contain series of information on candidates such as their education, experience etc. The dataset is free of cost and can be easily downloaded from the Kaggle website. 
#### 2. Data merging and cleaning
The next step was to merge the dataframes from Kaggle to a single dataframe and to clean it. We converted data into useful information as well as created new columns to analyize the data better for example we created new experience calss column from the experience columns that are already existed in the data set.
#### 3. Data Visualizations
In this part we did exploritory data analysis on the data and understood the relationships between the variables of the data by using graphs and pivot tables.   
#### 4. Applying Models
We applied two classification models, the logistic regressition and random forest and then we compared the results. 
#### 5. Streamlit Presentation
We are presenting our project using streamlit platform. We used streamlite because streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code.
